This has been created for an assignment for Prastuti-HackOverFlow
The task was to recreate the color picker website.

There is a random RGB value displayed.
On clicking easy, it renders three colored buttons and six colored uttons on clicking hard. 
One button has the same RGB value as displayed. 
The rest of the buttoms are of random RGB values generated by the program. 
On selecting the button that matches the RGB code displayed on top, the website will display all the buttons with the correct color and render a message on top.
In contrast, if the button selected is wrong, the site will render a different message and eliminate the button which was just picked.
